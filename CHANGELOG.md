## Unreleased

### Added

- Repository skeleton: module `github.com/riftbane/veduta`, MIT license, CI and release
  workflows.

### Decisions

- **Module path.** `github.com/riftbane/veduta` (the spec's `OWNER` placeholder).
- **Go version.** `go.mod` declares `go 1.25` (spec minimum); CI tests the two latest Go
  releases via `setup-go`'s `stable` and `oldstable` aliases. Development happens on
  Go 1.27.1.
- **Line endings.** `.gitattributes` forces LF for text files so `gofmt -l` is clean on
  `windows-latest` runners (where git defaults to `core.autocrlf=true`) and golden files
  compare byte-for-byte.
- **Cross-OS determinism check (§7.6, §14).** Instead of shipping trace hashes between CI
  jobs with third-party artifact actions, the expected trace hashes and frames of every
  `testdata/` scenario are committed as golden files. Each OS job compares against the same
  golden files byte-for-byte, so linux/amd64 and windows/amd64 are identical transitively.
- **Archive names (§13.1).** `<ver>` in `veduta_<ver>_<os>_<arch>` is the tag including
  its `v` (`veduta_v0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz`), matching the game archive names of §15.3
  (`demo_v0.1.0_windows_amd64.zip`). `install.sh` and `veduta update` use the same rule.
